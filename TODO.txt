BACK END                              
- logging
    - implement server log so errors starting can be diagnosed
    - log server requests
    - lets just get some file logs in here
    - make everything overall more expressive, without spamming everything to
      the console
- runtime
    - add option to have server run in background
    - possibly create worker threads to handle extra requests
- requests
    - there should be harder vetting for what is considered a "good request"
        - we only check the first line but not really any body of the request
    - we should look harder into what can be added to the content of a request
      and how to server it better to what is requested
- response
    - add option for page redirects
    - add mutiple domain name support
        - this also means extra domain folder support
        - (this will entail actually looking at content of requests)
    - add folder configs
        - auto configure what is the index, error page things like that
    - add customizable error pages,
        - overall add more customization to what pages are served in response
          to an error
- command line
    - what we have right now feels really messy, i think we should phase out 
      almost all together interaction via command line and transition to file 
      configs only
        - when you are running a server you want it to be run and go, there
         shouldn't be a bunch of hasstle with it on the command line
- code style
    - error handling should be more consistent, right now in net handler
      there is a mix between return amounts and throwing errors, we should
      try to move completely to one or at least set guidelines of what to 
      use where

FRONT END  
- squre stretches correctly moving from left to right, but not right to left
- start production of ball sketches
    - ya boi has to start drawing

OTHER 
- we have a script to stress test from a local computer with only one stream
   of requests, this script should be run from several seperate computers
   at the same time
- create a script that makes slightly more... *random* requests
    - cough cough spit straight garbage at the server
- I only know so many ways to exploit a server, ask someone else to take a look
  at it
